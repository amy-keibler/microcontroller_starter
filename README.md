# Microcontroller Starter

This is a [kickstart](https://github.com/Keats/kickstart) template for doing microcontroller development. It is based on the [knurling app-template](https://github.com/knurling-rs/app-template) project.

Currently, it supports the [nRF52840](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-Tools/Development-Kits/nRF52840-DK). As I become more familiar with embedded development, it will grow to support additional chips and other features such as USB and Bluetooth support.
